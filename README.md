# React template for testing

Created in order to have all the files without the unnecessary code in case I want to test something in React. However, its main purpose is not to be a replacement for `create-react-app` when having to start a new project but its intended for testing purposes.

## Usage

`npm create-react-app "name of the test"` to have all the **node modules** and the **json packages**. Then, replace the public and src folders with those of the repository.

`npm start` and a blank page should be seen in the browser.
